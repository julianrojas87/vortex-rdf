"""The dashboard harness's Vortex adapters, run over the fixture dataset.

`bench/run.py` runs each adapter in its own virtualenv and keeps going when one
fails, so an adapter whose binding call no longer matches the bindings'
signature drops out of the dashboard silently. Nothing else imports `bench/`
and the harness is too slow for CI, so this exercises each Vortex adapter's
build/open/count path over five triples instead of the dashboard's millions.

Only the Vortex adapters: the others' libraries are deliberately absent from
this environment (see `bench/adapters.py` on why each gets its own virtualenv).
